This repository contains a framework for the spatial assessment of social-ecological integration developed in "Integrated Urban River Corridors: Spatial Design for Social-Ecological Resilience in Bucharest and Beyond" (Forgaci, 2018).

The assessment framework consists of a system of indicators and a method of assessing social-ecological integration in URCs. Informed by an overview of current approaches to urban river assessment in urban planning and design, landscape architecture and landscape ecology, and structured by the four properties of URCs, the assessment framework comprises a system of social and ecological indicators of connectivity (with the sub-categories of lateral, longitudinal and vertical connectivity) and spatial capacity (with the sub-categories of spatial diversity, spatial quality, and spatial composition). 

The method of a mirrored assessment chart confronts social and ecological indicators of corresponding sub-categories (e.g. ecological spatial diversity and social spatial diversity) on corridor segment scale and on the scale of the URC. As a planning or design decision tool, this method of assessment highlights key areas of intervention for a minimum desirable goal of social-ecological integration. 

The in-depth application of the assessment framework can be found in Forgaci (2018).



The dataset was generated between 2017-xx-xx and 2017-xx-xx by Claudiu Forgaci and Daniele Cannatella, and it was last reviewed on 2021-09-20 by Claudiu Forgaci.
